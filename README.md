### Hello there

Hi, Iâ€™m Dylan, an incoming 4th year Computer Science major at UCSD interested in exploring different areas of software development and creating practical software to solve various problems. I got my start in software development writing software for 125 pound robots in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Most recently, I've been working as a tutor for the CSE department for classes such as Intro to CS, Data Structure, and Software Engineering. This summer I'm interning at Art of Problem Solving.

Try to guess what my profile picture says!

### Hello there

Hi, Iâ€™m Dylan, an incoming 3rd year Computer Science major at UCSD interested in exploring different areas of software development and creating practical software to solve various problems. I got my start in software development writing software for 125 pound robots in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Most recently, I've been working as a Coding Instructor at a CS education startup. This summer I'm interning at AppFolio.

Try to guess what my profile picture says!

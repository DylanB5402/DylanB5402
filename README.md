### Hello there

Hi, Iâ€™m Dylan, a 2nd year Computer Science major at UCSD interested in exploring different areas of software development and creating practical software to solve various problems. I got my start in software development writing software for 125 pound robots in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Most recently, I've been doing backend development, both for an internship with the San Diego Supercomputer Center and for a side project I've been doing on my own.

Try to guess what my profile picture says!

### Hello there

I'm Dylan (he/him/his), an incoming freshman at UCSD, majoring in Computer Science. Right now I'm working on a bunch of miscellaneous side projects while trying to find new ways to occupy my time since I'm not spending 20 hours/week at FRC meetings anymore. I spent most of my time in high school on robotics and controls and I'm looking forward to explore different areas of software in college.

Try to guess what my profile picture says!
